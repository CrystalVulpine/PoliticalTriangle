# Political Triangle

The political triangle test is an improvement upon the political compass. Instead of separating social vs economic beliefs, it compares your attitudes towards the 3 main political philosophies. While the original test attempted to harmonize the libertarian American right with the traditional hierarchical right by separating the economic and social axis, this still resulted in quite a few problems. For example, anti-statism and progressive statism were often conflated with each other as "libertarian". The right wing was described as laissez-faire free markets, but in practice was used to mean crony capitalism. This test, instead of trying to divide social vs economic beliefs, recognizes that there are three different main philosophies at the core of political systems: the (traditional) right favors hierarchy, the elite classes, and a well defined social structure; the libertarian side (the American right) esteems individual liberty as the top priority; and the left seeks equality, community, and collectivism.
