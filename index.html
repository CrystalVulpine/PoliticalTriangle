            <h1>About the Political Triangle</h1>

            <p>The Political Triangle is a political test, inspired by the <a href="https://www.politicalcompass.org" target="_blank">Political Compass,</a> that plots you on a triangular axis between Libertarianism on the top, Leftism on the bottom-left, and Rightism on the bottom-right. It's based on the belief that Libertarianism is an inherently individualist ideology, mutually exclusive with both the left and right.</p>

            <p>Those with higher "Libertarian" scores value individual liberty and free market Capitalism. Those with higher "Left" scores value equality and a socialist, command economy. Those with higher "Right" scores value moral purity and Nationalism.</p>
